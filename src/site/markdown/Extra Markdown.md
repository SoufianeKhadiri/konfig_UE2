#Applications of Queue data structure

Queue is useful in CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling. When multiple processes require CPU at the same time, various CPU scheduling algorithms are used which are implemented using Queue data structure.
When data is transferred asynchronously between two processes.Queue is used for synchronization. Examples : IO Buffers, pipes, file IO, etc.
In print spooling, documents are loaded into a buffer and then the printer pulls them off the buffer at its own rate. Spooling also lets you place a number of print jobs on a queue instead of waiting for each one to finish before specifying the next one.
Breadth First search in a Graph .It is an algorithm for traversing or searching graph data structures. It starts at some arbitrary node of a graph and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.This Algorithm uses Queue data structure.
Handling of interrupts in real-time systems. The interrupts are handled in the same order as they arrive, First come first served.
In real life, Call Center phone systems will use Queues, to hold people calling them in an order, until a service representative is free.

#Generics in Java

The Java Generics programming is introduced in J2SE 5 to deal with type-safe objects. It makes the code stable by detecting the bugs at compile time.

Before generics, we can store any type of objects in the collection, i.e., non-generic. Now generics force the java programmer to store a specific type of objects.

#Code coverage

In computer science, test coverage is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs. A program with high test coverage, measured as a percentage, has had more of its source code executed during testing, which suggests it has a lower chance of containing undetected software bugs compared to a program with low test coverage.[1][2] Many different metrics can be used to calculate test coverage; some of the most basic are the percentage of program subroutines and the percentage of program statements called during execution of the test suite.
Test coverage was among the first methods invented for systematic software testing. The first published reference was by Miller and Maloney in Communications of the ACM in 1963."Wikipedia".
